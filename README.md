<div align="center">

I have acquired a solid knowledge of the main languages and frameworks used in the development of web applications, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular. Over the past few months, I have decided to focus my attention on specializing in the platform Java. I started working on real projects using Java Framework, becoming familiar with SpringBoot, PostgresSQL, Postman.

My passion for technology prompted me to start my developer journey with Epicode School, a full-time advanced training course where I earned the Full-Stack Developer certification, but my life was also influenced by art and Photography in particular. In fact, I had the opportunity to complete a Bachelor degree in Science and tecnique of Art. This experience gave me a unique insight into creativity and technology, which prompted me to try to merge these two passions into my work.

If you are looking for a junior Full Stack Developer with specific skills in Java, please feel free to contact me. I am available for an interview, and I am sure that together we can carry out exciting and successful projects!
