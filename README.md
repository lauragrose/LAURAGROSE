I'm a former graphic designer who wants to take on a new professional challenge in the world of front-end and back-end development. I am passionate about technology and programming and I want to put my skills and abilities at the service of a company that aims at innovation and progress.

After studying and working as a graphic designer, I decided to take it one step further and deepen my knowledge of web development. I studied the main programming languages with Epicode and I developed some web interfaces to consolidate my skills.

Now, I'm ready to face new professional challenges and I'm convinced that my experience as a graphic designer has provided me with a solid foundation to work as a web developer. I have excellent ability to work in team and to solve problems in a creative way, skills that have been useful to me in my previous professional activity.
